        "Introduces advanced statistical methods used in sports analytics. Analyzes the impact of data-driven decision-making on team performance.Advanced sports analytics involves the use of data, statistics, and technology to gain deeper insights into athletic performance, strategy, and decision-making in sports. Here are some key aspects of advanced sports analytics:Player Performance Analysis:Analyzing player performance metrics such as speed, distance covered, acceleration, heart rate, and biomechanical data can provide coaches and trainers with valuable insights into an athlete's strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. Advanced analytics techniques, including machine learning and predictive modeling, can help identify patterns and trends in player performance over time.Game Strategy Optimization:Sports analytics can be used to analyze game strategies, tactics, and play-calling decisions. By analyzing historical data and game footage, coaches and analysts can identify optimal strategies for maximizing scoring opportunities, minimizing turnovers, and exploiting opponents' weaknesses.Opponent Scouting and Game Preparation:Advanced scouting techniques involve analyzing opponents' strengths, weaknesses, tendencies, and performance metrics to develop game plans and strategies. By understanding opponents' playing styles and tendencies, teams can adjust their tactics and formations to gain a competitive advantage.In-Game Decision Support:Real-time analytics tools provide coaches and players with instant feedback and insights during games. This includes data visualization dashboards, live player tracking systems, and performance analytics software that allow coaches to make informed decisions on substitutions, play calling, and in-game adjustments. How Analytics Is Changing Sports:Analytics has become immensely popular in the last decade, especially within the sport industry. Now with sport becoming more competitive and advanced, players and organizations are turning to sports analytics for answers and solutions to enhanced performance, understanding data and attracting fans and consumers more effectively.Take for example the sport of baseball and the topic of the movie, Moneyball (2011) that depicts the concept of having numbers tell the story instead of a scout with 25 years’ experience. Within this movie, you’re constantly reminded of General Manager Billy Beane and Harvard-educated and numbers-cruncher assistant manager Paul DePodesta (portrayed as Peter Brand by Jonah Hill in the movie) which is based on sabermetrics data analysis by guru Bill James (Hanchett, 2012).How can sports data and analytic measurements tell a story here, especially one that takes the team on an historic 20-game winning streak in 2002? This year proved to be a game-changer for other teams within Major League Baseball as well as other professional sport leagues. Fast-forward to 2017 and now most of the league is utilizing some form of data analytics to help measure player performance and in-game strategies (Hanchett, 2012).From a viewing perspective, MLB now has an analytical approach called Statcast, which allows viewers to gain another vantage point of a player’s speed, accuracy, distance traveled, etc. It’s a revolutionary and innovative tool that allows fans to analyze and understand the “big data” approach in today’s different sporting events. In today’s sport, you also have what’s called predictive analytics, which was first researched and studied by John Dewan with his creation of STATS Inc. and now runs Info Baseball Solutions (Hanchett, 2012).Aside from this is the notion of decision making and better performance on the field of play. It’s not just about pitching and hitting a baseball anymore. In today’s highly competitive analytic industry, it’s more about what the numbers and data tell managers, players, employees, clients, etc. Additionally, more sport organizations want to know a player’s longevity in the sport, heart rate, how fast an athlete is and how this can then impact what a player is signed to. Now, analytics can pinpoint if a player is really worth a $60 million dollar contract (Hanchett, 2012).In the National Basketball Association (NBA), there is an innovative analytic player tracking camera system called SportVU that is changing the way the game is being scouted and played. It’s one aspect to appreciate how great a player is, but what SportVU can do is analyze how efficient and effective a player really is not just in the first quarter, but in the fourth quarter as well. It can track how far a player is running and how much energy is really expended during the duration of the game. Twenty years ago, you couldn’t measure this, but now with this camera tracking system, you can track how efficient players are from different areas of the court. Sports analytics in the NBA is definitely taking shape and all teams are jumping in to stay ahead of the competition to figure out who the next big star is going to be.In the National Football League (NFL), teams and players are adapting to the innovative data analytic measurement tool called Catapult, which is considered wearable technology. Currently, it’s being used by some NFL teams as well as college football programs within the sport and this is a major analytic trend that’s not going to go away. Due to the new rules of the CBA agreement in the NFL, teams now can’t practice as much, so it’s essential for teams to be able to stay ahead of the competition and what better way to measure players’ performance and weaknesses than to utilize this wearable technology. Some of the data points it measures are fatigue, heart rate, player speed, etc.The big sports analytics focus recently in the industry is the notion of how analytics is helping measure other elements during a sporting event such as ticket purchases, fan engagement, fan interaction and more importantly, fan retention rates. Getting fans back to the stadium is a key element and analytical methods are becoming a major trend to measure these perspectives. What’s helping this become a reality is the use and innovation of technology and the adaption and combination of both of these trends within the sport industry (Hanchett, 2012).In the next 10 years, the sport industry will be for sure different and more advanced from an analytic perspective, but the question will be, how much? How will players, coaches and fans react to the different methods, approaches and analysis being thrown at them? As long as these methods, trends, measurements and approaches such as Statcast, Catapult, SportVU and other innovations enhance the viewing experience, or provide an athlete with an engaging and effective performance analysis, there won’t be any questions."

In a couple of years, we should expect these self driving cars in great numbers to be on the road. Electrification:When it comes to cars, electrification of vehicles is at its tipping point. With electric vehicles, cars will no longer need petrol, diesel, or traditional crude oil. These electric trucks will depend on a battery to function. This means less carbon dioxide and fossil fuel defense for electric trucks. Electric vehicles are expected to reach 13 percent by 2025 and 22 percent by 2030.Smart Technology:Without a doubt, smart technology is the future of transportation. These smart transportation technology examples are set to revolutionize the sector in the next 20 years. Future Trends in Transportation:In the next few years, we expect innovations in the transportation industry that will greatly improve our lives, and minimize death, cost, and even anxiety. The following examples will engineer the future of transport;Driverless Cars:With new truck engine technology, we expect to see more self-driving/driverless cars and trucks. Although reports vary, several industry experts believe that fleet vehicles including buses, trucks, and taxis will take control and make independent decisions. Although there are still plentyof questions surrounding the safety and regulations of driverless trucks, Tesla has already launched its autopilot system. Uber, Audi, and Volkswagen are also on their way to making headlines. Because of the number of deaths and business failures caused by distracted driving, self-driving trucks use computers to operate vehicles. This new transportation technology is designed to reduce speeding incidents and minimize risks. However, you should be aware of the hefty price tag, legal ramifications, privacy concerns, and ethical questions surrounding driverless vehicles. Underground Roads:Underground roadways are a reimagining of traditional road design. The goal is to make 3D roads to solve the issues of city infrastructure. This idea was conceived by Elon Musk who believes that underground roads will help speed transportation and prevent congestion. This new transportation infrastructure will use a system of tunnels that allow you to lower trucks underground before transporting them at high speed to different destinations. To ensure quick and cost-effective services, these underground trucks will use a metal trolley platform. Flying Taxis:The goal of this transportation technology is to transport people and goods to different cities using small planes. Flying taxis are designed to provide safe and affordable transportation of people and goods without being a nuisance to people on the ground. The problem, however, is that it isn't yet possible to build a durable and safe flying taxi following current market trends which require you to wait for the Federal Aviation Authority.Hyperloop:Another transportation trend to look out for in the future is the hyperloop. Hyperloop is a transportation tube that helps transfer groups of passengers and goods using a pressurized track. This new transportation technology is expected to run at a speed of 600 mph. With multiple companies working on these prototypes together, we should be hearing more about Hyperloop soon.Autonomous Trucks:Today several truck manufacturers are working to produce autonomous trucks and vehicles. This is a huge opportunity which will not only revolutionize the way people and goods are transported, but also ease congestion and improve road safety on busy roads.

For instance, creators are obligated to not only learn how these new technologies operate but also how to secure them from hackers. Security is important to also prevent attacks or theft. The truth is that for transportation to be customised, companies must ensure that their data is safe. Speed:Instead of spending so much time in transit due to traffic congestion or long distance, transportation technology can provide a faster and more efficient travel experience at high speeds. This will mean that we can spend our time on more productive things.Greenhouse Gas Emissions:Transportation is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions. With the United States generating around 28 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions in transportation to run trucks, cars, trains, ships, and planes, there is a demand for greener vehicles and electrification.Many engineers are now promoting clean solutions and renewable energy alternatives while reducing the use of gasoline and carbon emissions. Road Congestion:With most cities already maxing out their infrastructure, the future of transportation technology will help to reduce congestion and provide an alternative to traditional roads. This will obviously change the way our cities are built, as driverless vehicles that can drop us at our destination and pick us up later will make huge parking lots a thing of the past.Affordability:New transportation technology is expected to be affordable, eco-friendly, and inventive. Therefore it will promote income equality across the globe. This means that no matter how much you earn, you will still be able to get to work safely and efficiently.Conclusion:There are several logistic and regulatory challenges in the world today as a result of climate change, overcrowding, wealth inequality, etc. As a result, there is a wave of innovation leading the transportation industry across the globe. In the future, we are expecting a revolution in the sector, especially with the evolution of alternative fuels, IoT, etc. It is important to stay ready and prepare for the future of transportation."
